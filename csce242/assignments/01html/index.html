    <h1>Upcoming Formula 1 Race</h1>
    <p>
      The Dutch Grand Prix is set to return to Circuit Zandvoort from Friday,
      August 29 to Sunday, August 31, 2025, marking the 15th round of the
      Formula 1 season. The weekend will kick off with practice sessions on
      Friday, followed by FP3 and qualifying on Saturday, and culminating in the
      main race at 15:00 CEST (09:00 ET) on Sunday. The seaside circuit, nestled
      just thirty minutes from Amsterdam, promises a vibrant and electric
      atmosphere, especially with the enthusiastic support of the “Orange Army.”
      McLaren arrives riding high on momentum, with team boss Andrea Stella
      signaling they expect to continue their dominance at Zandvoort. Meanwhile,
      both Red Bull and Ferrari are cautiously optimistic, tweaking car setups
      to balance downforce and handling for the narrow, twisty layout of the
      Dutch track.

      Max Verstappen will undoubtedly be the center of attention at his home
      Grand Prix, making this his penultimate appearance at Zandvoort before the
      venue departs from the F1 calendar after 2026. Despite a challenging
      season, he remains determined to delight his hometown fans with a strong
      showing over the weekend. Concerns about track damage surfaced recently
      when a viral image suggested flooding and a hole on the circuit—but
      officials swiftly confirmed the track is fully intact and ready for
      racing. Fans can look forward to support events like the F1 Academy series
      and the Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup adding to the on-track excitement
      throughout the weekend. As one of the season’s most atmospheric and
      passionate stopovers, the Dutch GP promises to deliver drama, speed, and
      plenty of emotion before its departure from the calendar.
