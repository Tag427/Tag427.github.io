              <h2>Hard Tire</h2>
              <p>
                Hard compound tires are the most durable option in Formula 1,
                designed to last the longest distance during a race. They can
                withstand higher track temperatures and extended stints without
                significant performance loss. While they offer less grip than
                softer compounds, their consistency makes them ideal for
                endurance strategies where minimizing pit stops is key.

              <h2>Soft Tire</h2>
              <p>
                Soft compound tires are the fastest option, delivering maximum
                grip and performance. They heat up quickly and are perfect for
                qualifying laps or short, aggressive stints during a race.
                However, their high performance comes at the cost of rapid wear,
                making them unsuitable for long runs but invaluable for gaining
                time in critical moments.

              <h2>Medium Tire</h2>
              <p>
                Medium compound tires strike a balance between performance and
                durability. They provide more grip and speed than hard tires
                while still lasting a reasonable number of laps. Teams often use
                mediums when they need flexibility in strategy, as they can
                handle a wide range of track conditions and offer competitive
                lap times without wearing too quickly.

              Formula 1 cars are the pinnacle of motorsport engineering, built
              for extreme speed, precision, and performance. They feature
              lightweight carbon fiber chassis, advanced aerodynamics, and
              hybrid power units that combine turbocharged internal combustion
              engines with electric motors. Every component is designed to
              maximize efficiency and grip, from the sculpted wings that
              generate downforce to the intricate suspension systems that keep
              the tires firmly on the track. Capable of exceeding 200 mph and
              cornering with forces over 5G, F1 cars push the limits of
              technology and human skill.

              The McLaren Formula 1 car is a cutting-edge machine that blends
              advanced engineering with bold design. Powered by a
              high-performance Mercedes-AMG hybrid power unit, it delivers
              exceptional speed, efficiency, and reliability on track. Its
              aerodynamic package, featuring intricate front and rear wing
              designs, maximizes downforce while reducing drag, allowing the car
              to excel on both high-speed straights and tight corners. Clad in
              the team's signature papaya orange and blue livery, the McLaren F1
              car not only stands out visually but also represents decades of
              racing heritage, innovation, and the pursuit of championship
              glory.
