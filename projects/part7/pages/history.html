            </h3>
            <p class="event-text">
              The year 1950 marked the official birth of Formula 1 as a global
              sport. The inaugural race took place at Silverstone in England on
              May 13, where an estimated 120,000 spectators attended. This new
              World Championship brought together seven races across Europe—six
              Grand Prix events plus the Indianapolis 500—uniting drivers,
              teams, and manufacturers under a single international competition
              for the very first time.

              In 1958, Formula 1 expanded its competitive spirit by introducing
              the Constructors' Championship, giving teams their own title to
              fight for alongside the Drivers' Championship. While individual
              drivers had been the sole focus since 1950, the new championship
              recognized the crucial role of engineering, innovation, and
              teamwork in achieving success on the track.

              In 1967, Formula 1 entered a new era as major advances in car
              design reshaped the sport. Aerodynamic wings were introduced,
              giving cars greater downforce and stability at high speeds, while
              powerful new engine developments pushed performance to
              unprecedented levels. These innovations transformed Formula 1
              machines into much faster and more technically advanced cars,
              setting the stage for the modern era of racing.
